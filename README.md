### Project Description

### Overview

Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night images to day images? Also, you must have come across some photos of people who do not exist in the world. One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative Adversarial Networks, also known as GAN. GANs are mainly used in image-to-image translation and to generate photorealistic images which even a human fails to identify as fake or true.

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of Generative Adversarial Networks. We utilize the PyTorch framework to build a GAN model, leveraging the MNIST dataset. Our primary goal is to understand the principles behind GANs and how they can be implemented to generate new images of digits.

### Aim

- To understand the theory behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
- To build Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch.

### Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** torch, torchvision, numpy, matplotlib

## Approach

1. **Introduction to Generative Adversarial Network:** We provide an introductory overview of GANs, explaining their core concepts and how they work in the realm of image generation and translation.

2. **Introduction to Generator and Discriminator:** We delve into the components of a GAN, discussing the Generator and Discriminator networks, their roles, and how they interact in the training process.

3. **Loss Function in GAN:** We explore the importance of loss functions in GANs and how they play a critical role in training the networks to generate realistic images.

4. **Building Model on PyTorch:** We guide you through the process of implementing a GAN model using the PyTorch framework, explaining the code and key components.

5. **Model Training on Google Colab:** We demonstrate how to train your GAN model using Google Colab, taking advantage of its GPU capabilities for efficient training.

6. **Generating Fake Images with Generator:** Finally, we showcase how to use the trained Generator model to generate synthetic images of digits, highlighting the potential applications of GANs in image generation.
